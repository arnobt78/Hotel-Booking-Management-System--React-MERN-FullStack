# MERN Hotel Booking Website - React, Mongodb, Express.js, Node.js MERN Project

A full-stack hotel booking platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), TypeScript, Stripe, Cloudinary, and Playwright for end-to-end testing. This project demonstrates modern web development best practices, modular architecture, and real-world features for both users and developers.

## Environment Variables

### Backend (`hotel-booking-backend/.env`)

```env
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=
JWT_SECRET_KEY=
FRONTEND_URL=

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

# Stripe

```

---

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-hotel-booking.git
    cd mern-hotel-booking
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

- Backend: `cd hotel-booking-backend && npm install`
- Frontend: `cd hotel-booking-frontend && npm install`
- E2E Tests: `cd e2e-tests && npm install`

3. **Configure environment variables:**  

- See above for required variables in each `.env` file.

4. **Import test data (optional):**

- Use the files in `data/` to seed your MongoDB database for testing.

---

## Running the Application

- **Backend:**

    ```bash
    cd hotel-booking-backend
    npm run dev   # for development
    npm start     # for production
    ```

- **Frontend:**

    ```bash
    cd hotel-booking-frontend
    npm run dev   # for development
    npm run build && npm run preview   # for production
    ```

- The app will be available at [http://localhost:5174](http://localhost:5174) (frontend) and [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001) (backend).

---

## Testing (Playwright)

- **Run E2E tests:**

    ```bash
    cd e2e-tests
    npm install
    # Start both frontend and backend servers first!
    npx playwright test
    ```

- **Test Data:**  

Use the JSON files in `data/` to seed your database for consistent test results.

- **Test Files:**  

- `e2e-tests/tests/auth.spec.ts` â€” Authentication flows
- `e2e-tests/tests/manage-hotels.spec.ts` â€” Hotel management
- `e2e-tests/tests/search-hotels.spec.ts` â€” Hotel search

---

## API & Data Flow

- **API:**  
The backend exposes RESTful endpoints for authentication, users, hotels, and bookings.

See backend/README.md for full API documentation.

- **Data Flow:**  

- Frontend uses React Query to fetch and cache data from the backend.
- Authentication is managed with JWT and cookies.
- Payments are processed via Stripe.
- Images are uploaded to Cloudinary via the backend.

- **Shared Types:**  

All domain types (User, Hotel, Booking, etc.) are defined in `shared/types.ts` and imported in both frontend and backend for type safety.

---

## Deployment

- **Frontend:** Deploy to Netlify.  

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist`
- SPA routing handled via `netlify.toml`

- **Backend:** Deploy to Render.  

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Start command: `npm start`
- Set all required environment variables in Render dashboard.

- **Database:** Use MongoDB Atlas for production.

- **Other Services:**  

- Cloudinary for image uploads  
- Stripe for payments

---

## Extending & Reusing

- **Components:** All UI components are reusable and can be imported anywhere in the frontend.
- **Hooks:** Custom hooks in `src/hooks/` for context and logic.
- **Forms:** Modular form components for booking, guest info, and hotel management.
- **API Client:** Centralized API logic for easy integration with other projects.
- **Config:** Easily add new filters or options via `src/config/`.
- **Backend:** Add new models, routes, or middleware as needed.
- **Types:** Use and extend types from `shared/types.ts` for type safety across backend and frontend.
