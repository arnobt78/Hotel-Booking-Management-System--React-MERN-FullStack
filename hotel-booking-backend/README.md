## Project Overview

This backend is the core of a modern hotel booking platform. It handles user authentication, hotel CRUD operations, booking management, and integrates with third-party services like Stripe for payments and Cloudinary for image uploads. Designed for learning, production, and extensibility.

---

## Features

- User registration, login, and JWT-based authentication
- Secure password hashing with bcrypt
- Hotel CRUD: add, edit, delete, and list hotels
- Booking management: create, view, and manage bookings
- Image upload and storage via Cloudinary
- Payment integration with Stripe
- RESTful API with clear separation of concerns
- TypeScript for type safety and maintainability
- Environment-based configuration
- CORS and cookie management for secure frontend-backend communication

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend root with the following:

```env
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5174

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Stripe
STRIPE_API_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key
```

## Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-hotel-booking.git
    cd mern-hotel-booking/hotel-booking-backend
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**

    - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your credentials.

4. **Build the project:**

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

---

## Running the Backend Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

- **Development mode (with hot reload):**

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- **Production mode:**

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```

- The server will run on [http://localhost:7001](http://localhost:7001) by default.

- `POST /api/auth/logout` â€” User logout
- `GET /api/auth/validate-token` â€” Validate JWT

### Users

- `POST /api/users/register` â€” Register a new user
- `GET /api/users/me` â€” Get current user profile

### Hotels

- `GET /api/hotels` â€” List all hotels
- `GET /api/hotels/:id` â€” Get hotel by ID
- `GET /api/hotels/search` â€” Search hotels (by filters)
- `POST /api/my-hotels` â€” Add a new hotel (auth required)
- `PUT /api/my-hotels/:id` â€” Update hotel (auth required)
- `DELETE /api/my-hotels/:id` â€” Delete hotel (auth required)

### Bookings

- `GET /api/my-bookings` â€” List bookings for current user
- `POST /api/hotels/:id/bookings` â€” Book a hotel
- `POST /api/hotels/:id/bookings/payment-intent` â€” Create Stripe payment intent

### Example: Register a User

```http
POST /api/users/register
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123",
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe"
}
```

## Deployment (Render)

1. **Push your code to GitHub.**
2. **Create a new Web Service on [Render](https://render.com/):**
    - Connect your repo.
    - Set build command: `npm run build`
    - Set start command: `npm start`
    - Add all required environment variables in the Render dashboard.
3. **Set up a MongoDB Atlas cluster and update your connection string.**
4. **Set up Cloudinary and Stripe accounts for production keys.**
5. **Point your frontend (Netlify) to the Render backend URL.**

---

## Extending & Reusing

- **Models:** Add new fields or models in `src/models/`.
- **Routes:** Add new endpoints in `src/routes/`.
- **Middleware:** Add authentication, logging, or error handling in `src/middleware/`.
- **Types:** Use and extend types from `shared/types.ts` for type safety across backend and frontend.
- **API:** The RESTful structure makes it easy to integrate with any frontend or mobile app.
